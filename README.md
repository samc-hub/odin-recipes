I have learned basic html setup, relative/absolute links, moving around the command line, setting up repositories. I have learned not to make changes on github directly beacuse I compeletely screwed myself. I have learned that for some reason my links wouldn't work and hopefully i will figure this out this time around since i decided to delete and start over.
